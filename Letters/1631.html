<p>Landau, 8.9.17</p>

  <p>Dear Elsa!</p> 

<p>I have thankfully gotten your dear letter. Hopefully, you too got the letter that I sent to you last week on Friday? Yesterday, a non-commissioned medic officer was needed for a field hospital, and I right away volunteered, because up until now, every week 1 - 2 non-commissioned medic officers are sent out on the field, and I would have to be in line soon anyway, to go into the field; I thought to myself, now it’s time to make yourself safe. As a paramedic in the trenches nothing is certain.  One has it as good in a field hospital as in a war hospital. Maybe at the end of next week we’ll move out, to Romania in fact. It’s going to be a nice trip, one gets to see another piece of the world.</p> 
<p>I will be trying to get a vacation to Ludwigshafen, since I want to see you one more time before I go away. Who knows if I will come back from there, to the homeland.</p> 
<p>Please write to me again before-hand, dear Elsa!</p> 
<p>Greetings from the heart until then,</p> 
<p>From your friend Tony.</p> 

<p>Also, greetings from the heart to Mother, Grandmother and Erna.</p>
