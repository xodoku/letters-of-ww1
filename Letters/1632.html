<p>Dear Elsa!</p>
<p>I was very happy that I once again, got a little sign of life from you. Dear Elsa, it is strange that you didn’t get my mail that I sent you, I sent you 3 post-cards and a letter. Congratulations for your birthday was sent on 2.11. You will maybe have gotten it on the 7th or 8th.</p>
<p>Dear Elsa, [I] want to share with you a bit from my travel to Macedonia: when I departed out of Würzburg, with another non-commissioned officer and 6 orderlies, we stayed 2 days in Munich and were attached to a bigger transport of 700 men. The trip continued once again on the 25th, 7 days by train, this time to Gratzko, which lies in southern Serbia. From there on out the trip continued with cars to the field hospital. I didn’t get to see much of Vienna and Budapest, we traveled around outskirts. It’s sad, I would have liked to see those cities. The rations on the way weren’t the best. As we came to the destination we were tired as a dog. Our field hospital consists of tents, where it’s very hot during the day and very cold during the night. In fact, there are days here still where it’s 25-30o in the sun. The rations here are pretty good, I once again gained weight.</p>
<p>The surroundings here look {bleak}, one can’t see any tree or bush for as far the eye can see. About the only thing that one can see are {meadows} and bald mountains that have a height up to 1500 - 2000m. The population here seems extremely greasy. The men only have old rags on their body, and the women wear wide {bloomers} instead of skirts and every wife doesn’t forget to cover her face up to the nose.</p>
<p>Now let yourself be greeted from the heart, and write back soon to your friend Tony,</p>
<p>And very warm greetings to your family?*</p>
