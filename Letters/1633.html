<p>Dear Elsa!</p>
<p>You will have probably received my letter by now?! I have gotten your dear letter, for which I am again heartfully thank you.</p>
<p>Dear Elsa, I can unfortunately not get any food, since where we are located, there are just a couple of old shacks. There are absolutely no jobs here. It was different in Russia, there, there is one business next to the others in every little village. My parents have already written to me as well, asking whether I can get them food, but I had to tell them the same thing. I’m telling you dear Elsa, if you were here, you’d want to go go back again, that’s how miserable it is here.</p>
<p>We get visits from enemy airplanes almost every day now, as soon as they’re in sight everybody who can run, runs to shelter. A couple of days ago, two enemy airplanes got shot down, one of which we could see, as it turned over and crashed down burning. Sport is also practiced here; Slingshot game and football is played. Football is my greatest pleasure, since I have played a lot of football before.</p>
<p>Dear Elsa, what is there otherwise new? What does one say about peace in Germany? It’s rumored a lot around here. Hopefully, we’ll not have to wait too long for it.</p>
<p>For today I don’t know anything else about what to write.</p>
<p>In the hope that you and your family are doing very well, your friend Tony greets you from the heart.</p>

<p>And also many greetings to your family</p>
<p>Please write again soon!</p>
