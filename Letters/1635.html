  <h1>Kanatlarei 10.1.18</h1>

  <p>Dear Elsa,</p>
<p>Thank you from the heart for the dear letter that I got yesterday. The last letter I had gotten on the 30.11. The letters that you sent afterwards must have gotten lost, which, before Christmas,  is quite possible.</p>
<p>For the time being, we can’t think seriously about a vacation. I will probably stand in the line not before sometime in May or June, and if I’m still here at that time, I will probably get 4 weeks of vacation.</p>
<p>There was very strange weather here again a couple of days ago, it was fearfully cold here in the night, the thermometer rose to 25C during the day, and now it’s raining again so one that would think as though the world were going to ruin.</p>
<p>An interesting event happened here the other week: A Macedonian wedding trip on the way from Pottmoll[?] to Kleback[?]. The bride and the groom sat on an old wagon, handsomely dressed in their national costume; in front of them 6 Macedonians rode on donkeys; the first one of them played on a bagpipe, the second one was holding a banner, and the remaining 4 just rode along. The best thing about it was: that there were German soldiers standing nearby with a wagon that had 2 large barrels of water loaded on top of it. When the horses heard the bagpipe, saw the banner and the colorfully dressed bride, they went crazy. The barrels just flew off, the drawbar flew vertically up and when they had run about 30m, the whole wagon flew apart. The horses which were drawing the wagon on which the bridal couple sat, went crazy afterwards as well.</p> 
<p>That was a wedding trip with hitches.</p>
<p>What’s there new in Germany, dear Elsa? What does one say about peace? I think, it won’t last too long,  since we at least have peace with Russia. The English and the French will have already received their punches by spring, because they don’t seem to have had enough yet.</p>
<p>Now enough for today,  and be heartedly greeted, by your friend, Tony</p>

<p>Many greetings to Mother, Grandmother, Erna and Josse!</p>
