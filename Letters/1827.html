  <h1>Bl, T.K.(?) 6.4.15.</h1>

<p>Dear Grete & Kids!</p>

<p>Felix passed the things on to me today. He thought, you wanted to visit me perhaps next Sunday. I want to, however, advise you against it, since first of all, the [train] connections here are very bad & secondly, it is very unclear, if we can go out next Sunday. During the holidays, we had to take care of the barracks. Our major is a very strict man if fact, who lets us have little freedom. In contrast, the other officers & noncommissioned officers are reasonable people. I would like to, above all, come to you by the next opportunity. One is in good graces with our sergeant, when one delivers a larger sum of gold pieces to him. See if you can find any sort of gold. Ask Köbisch, maybe even Frau Eichler & also let Krüger know. The more, the better.</p>
<p>Even if it’s a few 100 Marks. One who turns in 20-40 Marks gets 1 day vacation. For more, correspondingly more. Don’t send the gold as a {sr.} money order, do it instead as an insured or registered letter. If you want me to stay with you for long, send a lot more money. Napfkuchen is by us. He sweeps the barrack room & makes himself always useful.</p>
<p>Max lies in another barrack room. He is thinking, however, about becoming free again. You don’t need to send me a pillow for my head. I don’t know where to put all the junk. One has to get used to the camp here. - The boots are plenty big [for me]. There aren’t any smaller ones here at the present time.</p>
<p>We don’t have boredom here. Even today, war articles were read to us.</p>
<p>On Thursday we will take the oath, tomorrow be vaccinated against Typhus.</p>
<p>Now, be heartedly greeted from your</p>
<p>Papa</p>
