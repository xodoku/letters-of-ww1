  <h1>Kanatlarei 4.10.15</h1>

<p>Dear Gretel!</p>
<p>Yesterday, we were in Vercecz, where a part of our battalion got dressed & from where I wrote you a postcard. I will give this letter the sergeant, hopefully, it’ll soon come into your possession.</p>
<p>A lot of wine is made in this area. I just drank for 1 mark & and took as much along with me. The city of V.[ercecz] is full of traffic, it has pretty stores and even better inhabitants. They called out to us during our parade: “forwards, German brothers!” The whole surrounding area is full of military here, everything is quartered [by soldiers]. On 6.10 the march against Serbia should begin, in fact, with a such power, so that the brothers get wiped out in a single strike & so we can come and help Turkey. It’ll be a similar battle as in Belgium & therefore it can be long until you get something from me again. Therefore don’t worry if you stay a long time without getting any message; everything will be fine. If the time is too long for you, you can ask the wife of my comrade, Margarete Rummel, Brumby (Calbe region) if he has written anything.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Grete and kids, farewell. Heaven will make sure we see each other safely again. Don’t have too many worries about me, it’ll happen as God wants it to.</p>
<p>Be truly greeted,</p>
<p>From your Papa</p>
<p>SS[? PS] I have not gotten mail from the homeland yet</p>
