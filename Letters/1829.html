  <h1>Serbia, 17.10.15.</h1>

<p>Dear Wife & Kids!</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, at 10, 3 km away from the enemy, we had a big handling of present. After 8 days, the mail finally came and I got your letters from 9. And 12. ds[?], as well as five packages, 4 from you & one from Reichenbach with schnaps. 3 are still missing from you. The 4 contained: sausage and bacon, 1 can of sausage, wool socks and battery, pot with eating utensils. I am very thankful for that. I will put the wool socks in my knapsack. The rest i’ll enjoy eating.</p>
<p>All that, of what you write, I found very interesting. I wrote to Dorre[?] today. He isn’t located in our region. What does concern us, we are since before yesterday so tightly near the front as the reserve for our protection lines. Under the circumstances, we must camp in the outside, which is very uncomfortable in the night insofar, as the hefty storm, that has been going on for 6 days, causes us to freeze. Today, It let up however. We weren’t directly under fire yet, however, we were shot at by the Serbs with shrapnel the night before yesterday, in which, from the 1st company 2 men were wounded. Both with blighty wounds. They can be happy, they can go back to the homeland & before they are called back into service once again, the war will maybe be over. Everyone curses this war. Everyone would like to go home. It’s all right here insofar as the Serbs aren’t very dangerous, since they don’t have much artillery. At least until now, they don’t hold their ground very well. They retreat when we assault.</p>
<p>The hefty storm is also inconvenient for us, in that field bakeries and other vehicles couldn’t cross the Danube. We could therefore have not been able to get any, & people are on the job of baking bread out of corn, which is abundantly available here. It doesn’t taste bad at all. We also get zwieback. We have had enough meat until now now, however. The poultry in the villages that we visited has strongly decreased. The troops that come later will find nothing from now on, however, from now on we will often not get a roof over our head. Even this letter I write to you in the forest, on the knapsack, under hefty fire from the troops fighting ahead of us. There is also no more washing. Since our dispatch we have constantly slept while dressed. Everyone’s like that and I will survive the crap as well.</p>
<p>It makes me happy, that the kids are eating well. I also like to hear that they are well behaved and don’t give you much trouble. If only we can be together again, then it will be good.</p>
<p>Just don’t forget to send me a battery every 10 days. Sent two light bulbs above all immediately. Mine became broken and I have temporarily borrowed one. Pack them well though.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Gretel, let yourself & the kids be heartedly greeted from your</p>
<p>Papa</p>
