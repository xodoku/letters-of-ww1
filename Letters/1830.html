  <h1>Serbia, 5.11.15.</h1>

<p>Dear Gretel & kids!
	
	<p>Today afternoon, I received your letter in Paratchin, as well as your card from 23.10. Many thanks for that. I, as well, am sorry that the packets haven’t arrive. Eating was pretty short just now, since the baggage has to put up with so many difficult things and comes in bad shape afterwards. And so we get only ⅓ of a bread daily. Anyhow, we have not experience any lack since we could get hold of enough meat. I congratulated mother and if the card wasn’t there on time, it has probably in the meantime. Unfortunately, your dream doesn’t seem to be fulfilled, since the 14 days have now passed. Just the same, the Serbs have suffered big losses here. Big masses of captives were transported past us, and the Bulgarians should be standing only two hours away from us. So the Serbs in these areas would soon be dealt with. Otherwise, it’s not true if one says the Serbs were bad. To the contrary, we have made an observation, that the people here are more forthcoming than in Southern Hungary. The offer us freshly baked corn bread, as well as meat and willingly leave their rooms for us to sleep in, as they, like how it was the case last night in a village, have to stay outside in the open with their little kids. I am still at the post, since my left knee is still a bit swollen. If I have to go with the others, I nevertheless have the advantage that I’m not in combat and have a roof over the head every night.</p>
<p>Today we came through two larger cities, first through Tschŭsnija[?] and then to Paratschin, where we are sleep. Look on the map, you’ll find the cities. Both are very beautiful places. The butter tasted very good, I also didn’t save, used it all in 2 days. It was, however, only one piece. I can very well imagine that Willy Nauman doesn’t like it in France. It’s not that dangerous where we are yet, only the bad roads! Whoever hasn’t see it, cannot imagine it!. How a person, livestock and wagon can hold up is a wonder. One has to constantly ask oneself, for what are these colossal efforts made? Something as nonsensical as such a war cannot exist! What need and misery comes upon a country, is shown simply by the many refugees that we encounter. People with ox wagons, on which they have as much as they can get away with. And then there’s the little children. The people, however, don’t complain at us, they instead take off their hat,  when they go by us. It would be good for all participating peoples, if peace would soon come. Today we feel human again, even live in a former pub that has electrical lighting. A pleasure, that we have not yet had in Serbia. There are even beautiful churches here. It would only be good if we were to stay here longer, but our stay will not be long. - You will wonder, why I, instead of today’s five cards, don’t write any letter. That is because the card letters that were sent to me were completely glued together due to the dampness, and are therefore unusable.</p>
<p>Now live well,</p>
<p>Be all heartedly greeted from</p>
<p>Your Papa</p>
