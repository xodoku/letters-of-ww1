  <h1>Kruschewratz[?], 20.11.15.</h1>

<p>My dear ones!</p>
<p>Yesterday morning I received a lot of mail and in fact, cards from 21.10 letters from 25., 28. and 31.10. Many thanks for that. The packages didn’t arrive yet.</p>
<p>Dear Gretel! Don’t worry too much! It will happen, as God wants it to. I have given the letter from Grossenhain to a wounded man. Bock can be happy, that he got away from the kilt[?]. I’d love to come to the butchering & stay, but unfortunately [I can’t]. One gets used to sleeping in the open during the night. One digs oneself in so deep across from the enemy, that one has full cover, lies down, when it’s possible, puts corn or hay underneath, covers oneself with the blanket and sleeps very cosily. The only thing that gets cold are the feet. One then walk around a little bit and then one is once again warm. However, what I wouldn’t give to be home. We’ve had it to the top. Did you receive the 15 marks, that I already sent some weeks before? On our return march we arrived again in Kruschewatz[?] yesterday, completely dirty however, since everything became muddy because of the snow. Today we have a day off, and since I got a letter from my comrade, I’ll write it to you soon. I am just curious, where we will arrive. Preferably, we’d come to the homeland. If only the cursed affair would have an end. The peoples must themselves understand that it cannot go on further like this. The men are going to ruin in the fields, and in the country the people cannot pay for food anymore. There must soon come a big breakthrough. I have gotten really soft in the field. When I think about you, which is always the case when we have time, tears come to my eyes. War is definitely the worst thing, that can exist. I recently ordered 2 pairs of stockings. One pair can be thinner, since I use it in order to put on over. If necessary, cotton [socks] will let themselves be put to that use. Then you can also send me 2 pairs of insoles, as well as a pair of underpants, from Reichenbach of course. And also send batteries regularly. I don’t have any anymore. One cannot buy anything in the cities here.</p>
<p>Dear Hans! Be happy that you don’t have to spend time in the enemy land. I would renounce seeing the whole wide world, if I could only settle down in the beloved homeland. One only appreciates the value of the homeland, when one must stay away from it. Yes, If one can travel for the pleasure of it, then it’s a completely different thing. If it’s difficult with your principal, bear with it and make the effort so that you can get ahead. By doing that, you’re serving your own interest the best, and give happiness to your parents. Believe me, we need it. If it doesn’t go so smoothly, just clench your teeth; I have to do that often as well in order to keep going.</p>
<p>Dear Paul! Just give greetings to the pigs and and Moppi from me. It makes me happy that you can do math so well. I will see if it’s true when I come to you again. Just keep on being so hardworking and keep the garden in shape. Does your rabbit not have any young ones yet? Here you could, however, eat nuts and honey. We have emptied so many bee hives.</p>
<p>And now, my dear ones, live well and stay healthy and well spirited. Pray, that we can be all together again soon. Please greet the parents and the Göhrings. Above all, be heartedly greeted and kissed by your</p>
<p>Papa</p>
