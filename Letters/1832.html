  <h1>Aken 30.11.15</h1>

<p>Dear Paul, Just now I have received a letter, a card letter as well as two cards {from} 12th, 13th and 20th. A thousand thanks for that. I sent you one battery and a piece of soap and a bratwurst and a piece of bacon. Today I sent off two pairs of stockings and 50 cigarettes. I am very unhappy that you didn’t get any packages yet. I also didn’t get any cards where you write about stockings. What all may have gotten lost? Tomorrow I will send you insoles. Do your comrades get packages? You probably think we have forgotten you. Food tastes bad for us because you don’t get anything. Today we have a good amount of freezing rain and just now I and the father had to bring the pig in. Mr Ülsmann helped us. It was, however, a difficult task. It weighed 3 hundred and 40 pounds. Tomorrow I’ll soon send sauerkraut whole meat[?] off to you. I’ll have a man to come to me from the harbor on monday, it’s too much and the pig is too heavy. To where will you now go papa? Not to Russia hopefully? I think, there isn’t much going anywhere, just come home. Very hearted greetings from us all. Grete - 40 blank cards are also on the way.</p>
