  <h1>Torontálvásáhely, 22.12.15</h1>

<p>Dear Gretel and Children!</p>
	<p>I received a letter from the 16. [...] and a card from the 17. [...] yesterday afternoon. Because of Weitsch I can unfortunately not undertake anything. It belongs to the II battalion and that lies in a very different village. We do not meet each other. We don’t make much think much of the wine here. We only get ordinary wine, which is a simple sour drink. This one has has no similarities with the Hungarian wine you know. We’d rather have glass of beer, which isn’t always available.</p>
	<p>As for the 100 marks for statistical work, I don’t know how Jochen came up with that. You can leave it for the time being, I’ll take care of it later by myself. I have only done these jobs for ¼ of a year, and then there’s Neenemann, with whom I must possibly make some adjustments. The food is expensive everywhere, as well as here. It is also because of this, that the time has come for the war to find an end.</p>
	
<p>Did Paul already find a lot in his shoe? If only one morning he would find his papa! How much longer will this last?</p>
	<p>III</p>
	<p>Just celebrate Christmas like you normally you would. I don’t have anything to hope for here. Anyway there is word going around around that we’ll move on further on the 26.12, on second holiday. If it’s true I don’t know; a lot of nonsense goes around sometimes. It is still possible though. Then I would gladly drag the big packages along.</p>
	<p>Paul Richter has luck, if he’s again on vacation again. It’s due to all the money he uses and. If he gets to Belgium or Russia,</p>
	<p>IV</p>
	<p>he can be happy, as an official, he probably doesn’t believe that himself. He’ll always stay a soldier.</p> 
<p>You don’t need to send me a neck pouch, I bought one myself already from a canteen proprietor. That 2 letters from me were open, might be because their content was checked by authorities. Such random checks are made after all.</p>
	<p>Last night there was frost with clear sky.</p>
	<p>Heartfelt greetings are sent to you and the kids from</p>
	<p>Your papa</p>
