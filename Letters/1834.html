  <h1>Russia 13.1.16</h1>

<p>Dear Grete and Kids!
<p>I write a letter to you yesterday, as well as before yesterday. Yesterday I asked you, my dear Grete, to send me a pair of mittens and wristlets. The cold is continuing here, however the wind has quieted down. Today mid morning we had a little practice march, which we liked more than exercising. Today evening should be the first time we get packages once again. Hopefully there are a number from you.</p>
	<p>Last night I thought about how it could be possible for me to go on vacation. An official certificate would be required, since there are still so many people in our company who’ve been here longer that I have and still haven’t been on vacation yet. I thought to myself, that I could be exempted by Hafen for a time of 8 weeks - ¼ of a year. Hafen has without a doubt so called war deliveries that need to be carried out, he could tell Herr Eichler that for the handling [of the war deliveries] the current help isn’t enough, that other help isn’t available and he therefore wants me to grant me a leave of absence for the previously mentioned time. I could in this matter directly approach Herr Eichler, I want to, however, avoid the appearance as if I, like Paul Richter cannot handle soldier life. I would, like I already said, be satisfied with a leave of 8-13 weeks. I could achieve a lot in the meantime. Maybe you’ll hear about this.</p>
	<p>Should this path now turn out not to be possible, I have another option. You constantly complain about your head, and that you can’t think. Maybe you *should* therefore undertake consultation with Figge and he could maybe issue a certificate about how your depression has gotten so bad, that the longer presence of your husband would be necessary in recovering of your health. I cannot go into more detail about this in this letter due to obvious reasons. This certificate would then have to be once again be verified, and major Placke could in this regard maybe add in a few words.</p>
<p>I would of course be so happy, if I could once again spend time with you, my dear Gretel, and our kids. Sometimes one has a strong longing for home, I can find it understandable, when someone here loses his head and his ability to think and ends   his life by his own hand. If one has always been together for the long years, and has gotten so used to one another, then one truly needs strong self control if one is bear up under such a long separation. See what you can do in this matter, dear Gretel, you’ll find the right thing to do. Out here, one cannot get any clear thoughts either.</p>
<p>Otherwise everything’s going the usual way. It is possible, that on the 17.1 we’ll come to digging trenches. Please write to me about my proposal as soon as possible. Heartfelt greeting to all of you</p>
<p>From your Papa.</p>
