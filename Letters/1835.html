  <h1>Russia 14.1.16</h1>

<p>I.</p>
<p>Dear Gretel and dear kids!</p>
	<p>I wrote a letter to you yesterday, in which I brought up a way to get vacation. Unfortunately, yesterday afternoon we received only letters instead of the expected parcel post, in particular ,I got your letter from 4. [...]. Our officers have already filed a complaint due to the long absence of mail, hopefully that’ll accomplish something. I also have only enough fat to grease 2 more times and I must push dry hemp [in], if I don’t get something soon. This should of course not be a reproach on you, since you can’t</p>
<p>II.</p>
	<p>do anything about it.</p>
	<p>Today we heated up in our hut, after we built ourselves a stove. It would, however, not be be approved by the police in Germany, since it consists of clay tiles put one over another, that we could not mortar together due to the lack of mud. We put an old broken iron pot on top and a cast iron pipe on the inside. Beforehand, we smashed a pane in the window, the latter we nailed with a board</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>and lead the pipe through. A disassembled tin can is the stove door. Of course this artistic creation shows many holes and cracks and every time we warm it up, it smokes so much, that we have to leave the hut and leave the doors open. If the fire is ongoing, however, *this way* the hut gets warm, and now during the writing of this letter, it is so hot, that we only have pants on, while the cold east wind blowing outside. Besides that, I’m lying on the ground, since a table here is a luxury.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
	<p>I cannot grasp that Paul Richter will complain at all. I would be very thankful to dear God if I was only fit for guard duty and could stay in the homeland. He must first experience that, what we have already lived through, then I’d find his desire for home comprehensible. Besides that he was supposed to become an official in foreign country, are these high soaring plans already faded away? It’s the old Adam, who’s speaking out of him. He never be anything else.</p>
	<p>Dear Gretel, it would of course be good, if you’d send me a pair of light shoes again. We will anyhow stay here for a longer time, and if one wants to go out of the hut, one cannot always put on the boots. I always take the felt socks that were sent to me, as long as it’s dry outside.</p>
<p>Otherwise that there is a very good atmosphere in our hut. We have 4 young guys in our group, and they don’t let their spirit sink. They always mess around with each other and do other such fooleries. One can’t keep oneself away from that as well.</p>
	<p>Heartfelt greeting to all of you.</p>
	<p>From your Papa.</p>
