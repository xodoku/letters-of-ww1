  <h1>Russia 23.2.16.</h1>

<p>Dear Gretel!
	<p>Attached here I send you two pictures, one represents our writing room and is drawn by my comrade. The windows shown weren’t in the hut, they were instead installed by us. Likewise the chimney was first built in by us. The other one is drawn by memory by me.  It represents the hut that we live in after our train ride from Aheli[?]. We lived with 9 men in the barrack room on the left. The houses are all built here the way you see in the picture. The is no solid building available here.</p>
	<p>Even today there is frost here. Today we got rations again , among other thing a rollmop and one big salted herring. Lastly, we made ourselves fried potatoes this afternoon, a food [we have] long gone without.</p>
	<p>There is nothing here about my application for leave.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, I’m still well and in good spirits, heartfelt greeting to all of you,</p>
	<p>From your Papa</p>
