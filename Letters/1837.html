  <h1>Russia 28.2.16</h1>



<p>Dear Gretel!</p>
	
<p>I received your letter from the 21.2 today at the same time as butter from Reichenbach, which still tastes very good. I have written to you each day as long as I was in batls.[?] office.</p> 
<p>Today it’s beastly cold here once again. I’m Guessing is 10 degrees of cold [-10]. The artillery is once again fully active in our surround area since yesterday. Our whole hut always wobbles when the batteries roar. Today afternoon we had haddock from the kitchen. It was a very nice meal. Altogether we don’t get that many rations currently. Every two days we get 1-2 rollmops, maybe also a herring, but a tough piece of cow meat and then a little bit of fat and butter. Even here there is sometimes canned sausage.</p>
<p>Dear Hans!</p>
<p>Just follow what Dr. Meyer tells you. Go, before all, into fresh air. It is unnecessary, that you constantly sit around at home. Always outside. If mama can’t go forenoon, then you go alone, to the village or otherwise to the roadway. Your suffering doesn’t get any better at home. And always do everything, what your mother tells you. Pull yourself together. If it doesn’t go, how one wants it to, one has to pick oneself up and say that the times are changing. Before all, don’t be such a problem for your mother, but instead do what she tells you. She means you well, and when I come home, I want to only head good things about you. Your mama and I now have so much on our mind.</p>
<p>Dear Paul!</p>
<p>So you want to visit me on Easter? Then i’d rather stay here for now, so I can show you everything that there is to see here. If you were now here, then you could nicely ride sleighs, since there is still a lot of snow here. And then then there’s the big cannons, that stand here! When they fire, one must beforehand lie down, otherwise the bang will knock you over. Make sure that you learn to shoot beforehand, since wolves come here more often, and everyone who walks outside in the free must take a long gun with them so that he can shoot the wolves dead, when they come. If you shot one now, then we take off the fur off him. That you would take home with you, and when you get out of the train you drape it around yourself so that mama thinks it’s a wolf coming out. Then she should get a good scare. And then you take a couple of lice with you, that you let crawl onto mama. Then she should learn to scratch. First you have to come.</p>

<p>Thinking about all of you with the best greetings,</p>
<p>Your Papa.</p>
