  <h1>France, 17.1.17</h1>
	
<p>Dear Gretel & Kids!</p>
<p>We have reached very acceptable lodgings. Our area has approximately 3000 inhabitants in times of peace, consists of solid, up to three story high houses and is a train stop. We are housing ourselves in a little room with electrical light and a little furnace, which is of course always kept in operation. A lot of canteens are maintained here. Other than that there exists a soldier’s home, a movie theater, a library etc. A bottle of carbonated water costs 10 ₰ [pfennig]. One gets nothing, however, to buy food wise. Well, I have, in the next 10-14 days a needs. I cannot eat all of the bread at all, since we now receive 1 ½ pounds per day.</p>
<p>Our area doesn’t lie far away behind the front, 7 km. The French haven’t shot in yet because 700 civilians still live here. The latter are being maintained by Americans. The distribution of foodstuffs is done by the mayor.</p>
<p>Up until now we’ve been living a very pleasant life. Today, for example the duty is area clean up in the morning, roll call in the afternoon. We don’t wake up before 8 in the morning. I haven’t had it so well in the field until now. If it goes on like this, then we can be very satisfied. One doesn’t apparently know, what to do with us here. It is therefore possible that we’ll be relocated somewhere else. The ongoing weather is very pleasant. Light frost with little snow. So I am, all in all, satisfied with my luck. </p>
<p>Did you all get barley from Obstlau?	</p>
<p>What’s the pig doing? Is Hans registered in Cöthen? Hopefully you all are healthy and in good spirits.</p>
<p>With the best greetings,</p>
<p>I am,</p>
<p>Your papa.</p>
