<p>Dear Gretel and kids!</p>
<p>After a multi-day pause, I received your letter from 28.1 yesterday. You write that you have not received any messages from me in 3 days; I have, however, written to you almost daily, at least every two days. I received a package with cigars and tobacco yesterday from Eugen Denst. He complains that they don’t have anything to eat. It would be sad in the big city. Yesterday our lieutenant again told us that is is prohibited to send fat, sausage, etc. to the front, and that the sender gets punished if it is discovered. It would of course not be all that bad. Just don’t send too much and above all, pack it well so that the content cannot be recognized from the outside. Feel bloody good still. Hopefully you too.</p>
<p>Heartfelt greetings,</p>
<p>Papa.</p>
