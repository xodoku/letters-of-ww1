<p>Dear Gretel!</p>
	
<p>My dear Gretel!</p>
<p>Now it’s the 2nd time that during the damned war I am forced to commemorate your birthday in enemy land. Nevertheless my wishes are no less intimate and heartfelt, than if I were personally near you. So accept good wishes for the day on which you complete your 37th year of life. May God grant that you may live through this day many times in full health and that you have the needed strength at these hard times to fulfill your double job as mother and as substitute father. Besides that I also wish in my interests, that the damned mess comes to an end and we can, in all simplicity mind our own business.</p>
<p>As a birthday present, I can hand you nothing more this time now, than the enclosed picture. As an explanation let me explain you, that the picture was taken in our own dear homeland. My face wasn’t captured that sharply, but is recognizable as mine anyway. The 3 people sitting are occupying themselves with peeling of rutabaga, since this fruit has come to such popularity and has currently such variety of use that one has to wonder where the beasts come from. Rutabaga isn’t just cooked alone by itself, but along with pearl barley or beans or potatoes or groats etc. You won’t believe how much variety the kitchen workers achieve in this regard. The most difficult part about this is, however, that these “beloved” fruit is frozen so strongly, that one has to chop it in two with the axe if one chooses to not first put it in a heated room for a few days and defrost it. The one standing right is looking to warm up his insides with a cognac bottle, too bad that it’s empty. - the one in the upper middle is occupied with cutting himself a slice of bread, but turns his eyes away from me in horror, since I want to hack myself a slice of Schlackwurst.</p>
<p>The picture also gives evidence of my full beard that’s coming in. But it has already been cut back once. I cannot let it grow long, since otherwise the gas mask, that we each received, doesn’t seal properly.</p>
<p>Well, that’d be all now. Celebrate your birthday really well and think thereby also of</p>
<p>Your far away</p>
<p>Papa.</p>
