  <h1>14.2.17.</h1>



<p>Dear Gretel!</p>
<p>Today is the 14th anniversary of our marriage. Hopefully we can atleast healthily live this day the next time together. Yesterday I received a cake from Emilie Rennau, which I let myself enjoy. I sent the empty carton back to you today and inserted the one from the cognac along with the empty bottle, also some cakes. Did you not receive any packages from me yet?</p>
<p>Last night we had a heavy cannonade, right close by us. At 3 o’ clock the artillery barrage started and lasted for 1 hour. Such a firing I have not heard yet. We woke up from that. This was for a strong patrol advance of ours into the French held village of Neuviller[?]. This action succeeded completely, we only had two wounded. 7 captives were returned, including one Italian. So these brothers are also deployed here. Yesterday noon we had rice with dried fish, today the famous rutabaga again. Yesterday afternoon there was good butter, today it’s going to be marmalade again. The weather is holding good. It freezes lightly during the night, during the day it melts in the sun.</p>
<p>Be mindful of my address; Leave out “west”.</p>
<p>With the best greetings, I am</p>
<p>Your papa</p>
